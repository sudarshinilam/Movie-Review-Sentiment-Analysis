# Movie-Review-Sentiment-Analysis

## 📖 Project Description
This project is about analyzing the *sentiment of movie reviews*.  
It uses *Natural Language Processing (NLP)* and *Naive Bayes classifier* to classify reviews into:
- Positive 😊
- Negative 😡
- Neutral 😐  

The dataset (IMDB Dataset.csv) contains sample movie reviews with sentiment labels.  
The project also includes *visualizations* (distribution of sentiments, confusion matrix) and lets you *predict sentiment for a new review*.
